## Project Description
This project delves into the application of Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for the accurate identification and matching of distinctive keypoints in images, culminating in the 3D reconstruction of the captured scene. The project includes a detailed theoretical background as well as practical implementation of these techniques.

## Repository Structure
- "main.ipynb" : A Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation of the computer vision techniques. The notebook is primarily code-focused, demonstrating the practical application of concepts discussed in the report.

- "report.pdf" : A comprehensive report providing the theoretical background and detailed explanation of the techniques used in the project. It includes a discussion on the choice and strengths of SIFT in computer vision.

## Key Concepts
